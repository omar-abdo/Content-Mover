# Content-Mover
Bash script to move stuff around.

Put the bash script in the Repo folder for the source content (cybersecurity-v2).
It will generate a Folder for the weekly content (cybersecurity-v2/04-Administration).

After generation, just move that folder into the GitLab repo then use Git add, commit, and push.
You'll need to supply your default browser directory for the .pdfs.
